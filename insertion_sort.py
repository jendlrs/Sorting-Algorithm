#Insertion Sort

#Step 1: Divide the array into two parts: sorted and unsorted. For the first iteration, only the first element is in the sorted part
#Step 2: Get the first element in the unsorted part, then compare the values, swap until it reaches the correct position.
#Step 3: Repeat until all the numbers are sorted.

#Assigned the array values
numbers = [41, 4, 47, 94, 40, 66, 42, 23, 60, 55]
